** Critical Success
If you roll a natural 20 on your spellcasting check, you may double one of the
spell’s numerical effects. This remains in effect on a focus spell until your
next focus check.

** Critical Failure
If you roll a natural 1 on your spellcasting check, the spell does not take
effect. If it was a *focus* spell, the spell immediately ends.

Your deity is greatly displeased and revokes its power. You can't cast that
spell again until you complete a ritualistic penance to your deity and
successfully complete a rest.
*** Priest Penance
The GM determines the exact nature of the penance you must undertake based on
your deity and alignment.

Penance requires a holy quest, ritualistic atonement, or a material sacrifice
that you donate or destroy.

Inadequate or subversive penance (such as donating your sacrifice to a party
member) only displeases your deity further and makes the spell loss permanent.

**** Sacrifice Value by Spell Tier
1. 5 gp
2. 20 gp
3. 40 gp
4. 90 gp
5. 150 gp
