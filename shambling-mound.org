This is a short journal of my project to 3D print and paint a Shambling Mound mini.

If you're not familiar a [[https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17011-shambling-mound?srsltid=AfmBOor6Kr0Y3KnSUNwX81uFpGzPakMcqUguxSticG9yYOV6DLwGQaIj][Shambling Mound]] is a D&D monster dating back to the
original [[https://www.americanroads.us/DandD/ADnD_1e_Monster_Manual.pdf][Monster Manual]] by Gary Gygax in 1977.

#+begin_quote
Shambling mounds, or "shamblen," are found in dismal marshes or
certain wet subterranean places. They are omnivorous, feeding upon any
living material (via their weird roots and tendrils). They attack fearlessly,
clubbing with their limbs twice per melee round. If both of a shambler's
clubbing attacks hit a single opponent, the victim is entangled and will be
suffocated in the creature's slime in 2-8 melee rounds unless the creature
is killed.

The brain of the shambler is located in its mid-portion, and its thick fibrous
layers make it difficult to penetrate to its only vital area. In fact, most hits
upon it do but little damage. As it is wet and slimy, fire
has no effect, lightning causes it to grow (add 1 hit die), and cold does
either one-half or no damage due to its vegetable constitution. All
weapons score only one-half damage. It can flatten itself, so that crushing
has small effect. Spells which affect plants are effective against shambling
mounds, plant control and charm plant being good examples.

I'm a patreon subscriber to [[https://www.theprintinggoeseveron.com/][The Printing Goes Ever On]]. They released a set of
models called [[https://www.theprintinggoeseveron.com/shop/beowulfs-deceit-february-2025/][Beowulf's Deceit]] that included a Shambling Mound. Pictured to the
left is a /rendering/ of the model (that's not an actual print). You can barely
see the face of an adventurer that's been absorbed into the shambler. This model
also looks to be inspired by [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/][Stranger Things]]. The head/mouth of the shambler has
a very close resemblance to the head/mouth of the Demogorgon from season 1 (as
pictured to the right). It's also worth nothing that the Spider Monster of
season 3 was a form of a flesh thrall that would absorb bodies to become a very
gross amalgamation. While the shambling mound is entirely plant based (as
opposed to flesh/bone based), it also can absorb creatures into it.

I recently bought a [[https://bambulab.com/en/a1-mini][Bambu Lab A1 mini]] 3D printer. I had resisted buying one for
a long time. However, my daughter was saying she wanted to try 3D printing some
of her art projects. Then I saw the [[https://www.theprintinggoeseveron.com/shop/welcome-trove-remastered-and-expanded/][Welcome Trove]] from TPGEO that was beautiful
models of Tolkien's Fellowship of The Ring. There was an end of year sale on the
A1 mini, and here we are.

The A1 mini is a great little printer. There's definitely some technical skill
to get any printer to produce good prints. It's been a learning journey for
sure. My son was doubtful my printer could do this model justice, but I think it
turned out great.

Because I'm just learning to paint, I'm still experimenting with various
techniques. I bought [[https://us.thearmypainter.com/products/speedpaint-starter-set-2-0][Army Painter's Speedpaint Starter Set]] to use a technique
called [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH3WGHw9eDw][Slapchop]]. The basic idea is to prime the mini in black, paint a grayscale
undercode paying close attention to your light source and then paint with mostly
translucent contrast paints. With the thinner paints, the under paint of
highlights increases the value of the colors.

The left-most image is my first attempt. On a pure black prime, I used a dry
brush to mostly cover it with gray. This left the darkest parts still black, but
most of the model was dark gray. I then did another coat with a brighter gray.
This left a nice gradient between the blacks and most of the model that was
brighter. Then I went back with an almost white ([[https://gnomishbazaar.com/products/vallejo-model-color-pale-sand-70837?srsltid=AfmBOop3PQL06V9VmsSL8wwR21na2QksZPPQTdU7KO5I9f8UGOw17-WW][Vallejo Model Pale Sand]]) and
dry brushed just the highlights. After that, I used [[https://a.co/d/ikH3rdn][Citadel Nuln Oil]] shading
wash to add back some of the details by filling in the dark edges.

After letting the wash fully dry, I did a little highlighting with a brush using
straight Pale Sand. After showing some folks online, they suggested adding more
highlights. So the next picture to the left is after I went back and touched up
as many of the hightlights as I could without losing the contrast.

One of my favorite series of tutorial videos for this technique is from Dana
Howl. She has a great video on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYWYDv8Gq0][How to Underpaint Minatures]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A13JfFJxtIg][How to Glaze
Minatures]]. She also has another video on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hchM22RIsnU][How to Plan Color Schemes using MS
Paint]]. I've put a lot of effort into this shambling mound and I don't want to
screw it up. Frankly, I'm a little scared to put color on it.

So I decided to use Dana's MS Paint technique, but using Procreate on my iPad.
Dana also has a page up showing how all the [[https://howlcorp.com/colors][colors]] look painted on actual minis.
I went through that page and built up a color pallet. Using that I was able to
paint a 50% transparent layer with various colors. My goal was to figure out
what parts were brown/woody, what parts were green/planty.

The images to the right are not actually painted in real life. That is an export
from Procreate. I thought this was really neat. I could definitely make a few
more attempts. I really only used one brown, a red, and two or three greens.
There's probably an opportunity to use some yellows and oranges too. This kind
of color pallet work is an area I need more practice.
