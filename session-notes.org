* Background
Word has recently reached your area that two of the area's adventurers, the
Warlord Rogahn the Fearless, and the Sorcerer Zelligar the Unknown, have been
killed while on campaign in a distant land, fighting barbarian hordes. They left
on their campaign several years ago, but news of their death has only just
filtered back to this area.

These adventurers gained their reputation by repelling a barbarian invasion of
these lands many years ago. Rogahn slew a horde singlehandedly, and Zelligar's
magic put the army to flight.

The other thing that they are known for is for having invested most of their
treasure into their stronghold, a hidden complex, far from any well-travelled
route.

With the news of their death, people began combing the countryside for signs of
their stronghold. You seem to have found something...
